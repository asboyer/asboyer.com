        <p class="post-text-intro">
            During February of 2021, I created a website called <a href="https://goatgrade.com" target="_blank">Goat Grade</a>. It used Python, HTML (no CSS because I was lazy), and data from <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/" target="_blank">Basketball Reference</a> to rank NBA players based on their in-game stats and display my rankings online. After I uploaded it to the internet, I didn't think too much of it. A few months later, the NBA MVP finalists were announced. To my surprise, my algorithm predicted the top <a href="https://www.nba.com/news/kia-mvp-ladder-nikola-jokic-finishes-no-1-among-pack-of-contenders" target="_blank">two front runners</a> in the race for most valuable player. After <a href="https://www.nba.com/kia-mvp/2021-nikola-jokic" target="_blank">Nikola Jokic</a> was announced the league MVP, it was official: a program I wrote in a weekend had predicted which player was going to win MVP months before the finalists were even announced. This is the story of how I built <a href="https://goatgrade.com" target="_blank">Goat Grade</a>, my current plans to improve it, and why my prediction may have actually been a total fluke after all.

            <span class="tab"></span>The inspiration behind this project came in a variety of ways. I had just wrapped up the first half of my junior year of high school, blah, blah, blah. Here is some code:
