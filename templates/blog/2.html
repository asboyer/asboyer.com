    A special thanks to everyone who supported my <a href="https://asboyer.com/blog/1" target="_blank">previous post</a>.
    I know its been a while since I've updated this blog and I've made my "every two weeks" promise laughable. I want to create meaningful, thoughtful, and quality blog posts. I'll always be working on posts and they will be published when they are ready. I'm aiming for something more realistic, perhaps twice a month. I have a lot of great ideas that I am excited to share here. Anyways, on with today's post.

<p class="post-text">
    I was introduced to philosophy by my 10th grade English teacher, Mr. Vonnegut. In his class, we would read literature and then explore philosophy to further discuss what we read. As we studied novels such as <i>Of Mice and Men</i> and <i>Brave New World</i>, we learned philosophies ranging from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism" target="_blank">Existentialism</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche" target="_blank">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato" target="_blank">Plato</a> and the tripartite soul.
    <br>
    Throughout the year, I was posed with this question: "what is the good life?" The first assignment was called "The Good Life Vignette", where we were tasked to write a brief description illustrating what we would want our life to look like in twenty years <a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote1" id="footlink1">[1]</a>. Each essay, book, and activity always circled back to the central question of the "good life" and how to achieve it.
    <br>
    Over the course of the year, I learned that literature gives us <b>implicit</b> answers to big questions <a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote2" id="footlink2">[2]</a>. We can derive our own meaning from <i>1984</i>. "<i>Maybe</i> George Orwell was trying to tell us..." On the other hand, philosophy gives us <b>explicit</b> answers to these questions. Philosophers directly tell us their beliefs and their answers to big questions. They don't subtly hide or layer their ideas into novel or play <a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote3" id="footlink3">[3]</a>.
    <br>
    Philosophy literally means "love of wisdom." We look to philosophy (we <i>philosophize</i>) to understand fundamental truths about ourselves and the world. Personally, I turn to philosophy when I'm feeling lost and need not only some kind of straightforward direction, but a <i>why</i>. <i>Why</i> should I do this instead of this? <i>Why</i> is this meaningful? <i>Why</i> is this painful? 
    <br>
    The further I explore philosophy, the more I understand "the good life". The good life is not a destination, it is not something we achieve by making more money, gaining more friends, or receiving more recognition. The good life is in <i>how</i> we live <i>now</i>. 
    <br>
    While many great philosophers have their own <i>how</i>, one particular school of thought sticks out to me most: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism" target="_blank">Stoicism</a>.

<a class="footnote-link" href="#footlink1">[1]</a> Maybe one day I will publish this vignette. It was pretty good, in my opinion. But then again, it was <i>my</i> vignette after all.

<p class="footnote" id="footnote2">
<a class="footnote-link" href="#footlink2">[2]</a> Questions like "what is the good life" or "how can I be happy?"

<a class="footnote-link" href="#footlink3">[3]</a> I'm not saying I prefer one over the other. Sometimes a story is the best way to get a point across.
