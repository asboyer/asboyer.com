    A special thanks to everyone who support my <a href="https://asboyer.com/blog/0" target="_blank">previous post</a>.
    I know its been a while since I've posted on this blog and I've definitely broken my "post every two weeks" promise. I want to make posts that are meaningful, thoughtful, and of high quality. I'll always be working on posts and they will be published when they are ready. I'm aiming for something more realistic, perhaps twice a month. I have a lot of great ideas that I am excited to share on here. Anyways, on with today's post.

<h3 class="post-text-header" id="beginnings"><a href="/blog/1#beginnings">Philosophy</a></h3>
<p class="post-text">
    I was introduced to philosophy by my 10th grade English teacher, Mr. Vonnegut. In his class, we would read literate and then explore philosophy to determine if the particular book agreed or disagreed with certain schools of thought. For example, I remember our class discussing if <i>Of Mice and Men</i> supported or questioned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism" target="_blank">Marxism</a>.
    <br>
    Throughout the year, we were posed with this question: "what is the good life?" Our first assignment was called "The Good Life Vignette" where we were tasked to write a brief description illustrating what we would want our life to look like in twenty years <a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote1" id="footlink1">[1]</a>. Each essay, book, and activity always circled back the central question of the good life and how to achieve it.
    <br>
    As we read novels such as <i>Brave New World</i> and <i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</i>, we learned about different philosophies ranging from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism" target="_blank">Existentialism</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>and philosophers like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle" target="_blank">Aristotle</a> to 
    <br>
    I learned that literature gives us <b>implicit</b> answers to big questions <a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote2" id="footlink2">[2]</a>. We can derive our own meaning from <i>1984</i>. "<i>Maybe</i> George Orwell was trying to tell us..." On the other hand, philosophy gives us <b>explicit</b> answers to these questions. Philosophers directly tell us their beliefs and what they believe is the optimal way to live and think. They don't subtly hide or layer their ideas into novel or play <a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote3" id="footlink3">[3]</a>.

<p class="footnote" id="footnote1">
<a class="footnote-link" href="#footlink1">[1]</a> Maybe one day I will publish this vignette. It was pretty good, in my opinion. But then again, it was <i>my</i> vignette after all.
</p>
<br>
<p class="footnote" id="footnote2">
<a class="footnote-link" href="#footlink2">[2]</a> Questions like "what is the good life" or "how can I be happy?"
</p>
<br>
<p class="footnote" id="footnote3">
<a class="footnote-link" href="#footlink3">[3]</a> I'm not saying I prefer one over the other. Sometimes a story is the best way to get a point across.
