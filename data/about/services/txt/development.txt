of Development
Since the summer of my freshman year of high school, I've self taught myself the fundamentals of development and programming.
I am passionate about creating with code and bringing ideas to life with software. 
Not only am I passionate about teaching myself, but I love to teach others how to leverage software for good. 
I teach as a coding instructor, tutor, and lead my high school's computer science club. 
Ironically, what really got me interested in software was hardware. 
In the spring of 2020, I built my own computer. 
Through this process, I learned a lot about how computers work, and consequently, how software interacts with the computer. 
I am familiar with programming languages and technologies such as Python, Java, and JavaScript.
