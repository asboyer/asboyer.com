Cybersecurity
Aside from development, computer security, networking, and the IoT deeply interests me. 
I developed this curiosity by attending a two-week intensive cybersecurity summer camp at Syracuse University, which ended in a capture the flag hackathon. 
I've also started a business around teaching students the basics of computing and the Internet through a summer camp. 
Aside from summer camps, I also love to compete in virtual CTF competitions, and my team finished top 50th in the country in CMU's picoCTF 2021. 
Familiar with operating systems like Ubuntu and Kali Linux, and can adequately leverage command line technologies and tools.
