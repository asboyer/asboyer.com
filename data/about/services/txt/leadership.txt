Leadership
I am always looking for an opportunity to lead, whether that be in the world of software, or elsewhere. 
Starting with computer science, I am the President of the Wayland Computer Science Club, where I lead the club in weekly meetings and help students pursue their passions in computer science. 
I am also the founder and lead organizer of Reboot Hacks, an organization that runs free hackathons for high schoolers. 
Our most recent event focused on creating software to assist with remote learning. Aside from computers, I am an Eagle Scout, and active member of the National Eagle Scout Association. 
In 2019, I led my Boy Scout troop in constructing a fully functional, weather-proof baseball scoreboard for our local Little League.
