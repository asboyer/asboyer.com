                As I begin to prepare for the upcoming <a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/exam">AP Computer Science</a> exam in May, I thought that writing this blog post would be creative way to review and share what I have learned over the course of this year in my class.

                This post will take you through everything that I am reviewing to prepare for the exam. To preface, I am taking AP Computer Science A, which is taught in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a>. I would also like to add that I do not claim myself to be an expert exam taker, or even a Java expert. I am just a student reviewing for an exam.
                </p>

                <p class="break"></p>

                <p>
                While Java isn't necessarily my <em>favorite</em> programming language, it teaches the basics of <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/object-oriented-programming-concepts-21bb035f7260/">object-oriented programming</a>, and programming in general, very well. While I did have programming experience, I had zero Java experience going into this school year. If I would say anything about the class itself, I would say that the focus wasn't as much on the actual syntax of the language, but on the fundamentals of programming. This is reflected in the exam as well. Most syntax errors on the exam don't even result in point deductions!

                In this guide, I will go through all of the core topics that are taught in class, and tested on the exam. I will also throw in some other helpful tips and concepts that aren't specifically tested on the exam, but are extremely helpful to know about.

                I will do my best to review concepts using snippets of code, as well as explanations and images. Towards the end of each section, I included a few practice questions that will highlight the concepts discussed previously. At the end of this post, I have also included two practice FRQ explanations, as well as a list of resources that are also helpful to review.

                <p class="break"></p>

                <p>
                Let's break down everything going on here. As it appears, it takes a bit more effort to get a Java program up and going, especially if you are coming from a scripting language like Python, where all you need is 
                
                <code class="inline"><span class="blue">print</span><span class="white">(</span><span class="yellow">"Hello World!"</span><span class="white">)</span></code>. 

                For those following along, you can run this program in your terminal like this:
                </p>

                <p class="break"></p>

                <code class="inline">$ javac HelloWorld.java && java HelloWorld</code>

                <p>
                This code will, of course, print <code class="inline">Hello World!</code> to the console. Please note that the name of your file must be <code class="inline">HelloWorld.java</code> if you're class name is <code class="inline">HelloWorld</code>. In other words, the name of your file <em>must</em> be the name of your class.
                </p>

                <p class="break"></p>

                <p>
                Okay, now we can get into what is really going on here, starting with 
                <code class="inline-custom"><span class="blue"><em>class</em></span> <span class="green">HelloWorld</span></code>. This line is called a <span class="term">class definition</span>. The line uses the keyword <span class="term">class</span> to declare that a new class is being defined. A Class in Java is like an object constructor, which is the basis for everything in Java, because Java is an object-oriented programming language. The contents of the class is everything in between the corresponding curly braces <code class="inline-custom">{ }</code>. <code class="inline-custom"><span class="green">HelloWorld</span></code> is an identifier that is the name of the class.
                </p>

                <p class="break"></p>

                <p>
                The next line of code in our program is called the <span class="term">main method</span>. In Java, every program must contain this method. The main method is the "entry point" for the program, and this is the code that actually "runs" when we run the program. Code outside of the main method will not execute unless it is being called from inside the main method. But, this main method is a pretty complicated line of code:
                </p>

                <p class="break"></p>

                <code class="inline-custom">
                    <span class="red">public static</span> 
                    <span class="blue"><em>void</em></span> 
                    <span class="green">main</span>(<span class="blue"><em>String</em></span><span class="red">[] </span>
                    <span class="orange"><em>args</em></span>)
                </code>
                
                <p>
                Let's go from left to right. The <code class="inline-custom"><span class="red">public</span></code> is so that the <span class="term">Java Virtual Machine</span> (JVM) can execute the method from anywhere. The specifics behind the JVM and how is works is enough for an entirely different blog post, so I will skip on the details for that. Next, we have <code class="inline-custom"><span class="red">static</span></code>, which is there so that the main method can be called without an object. The <code class="inline-custom"><span class="blue">void</span></code> is there to specify that the method doesn't return anything. We have the <code class="inline-custom"><span class="green">main</span>()</code> because that is the name configured in the JVM, and <code class="inline-custom"><span class="blue"><em>String</em></span><span class="red">[] </span> <span class="orange"><em>args</em></span></code> is there because the main method accepts a single argument: an array of elements of type String (the name of the array is "args").
                </p>

                <p class="break"></p>

                <p>
                So, now we know what a <span class="term">Class Declaration</span> is and why we need a <span class="term">Main Method</span>. Let's move on to analyzing the actual code that is running.
                </p>
