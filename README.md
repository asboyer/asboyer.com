### Working on:
> - [ ] Predicting NBA with Python blog post
> - [ ] All time books section
> - [ ] Reading list section
> - [ ] Awards and honors section
> - [ ] Podcast section
> - [ ] Adding physical articles into "in the news" section
> - [ ] Need to organize CSS (getting too large of a file)
> - [ ] Page organization

### Ideas:
> - [ ] Self learning computer science resources
> - [ ] What I am trying to learn this summer and resources I am using
> - [ ] Add language I am learning in technologies section
> - [ ] Favorite Spotify playlists music section
> - [ ] Mixes available for download music section 
> - [ ] Need more interactive user features

### Long term goals for the site:
> - [ ] Make for easier domain navigation, so rather than typing asboyer.com/#about, type asboyer.com/about or rather than typing asboyer.com/music.html, just type asboyer.com/music *need to learn how to do this*
> - [ ] Create some kind of consistency around blog posts and optimize that workflow
> - [ ] Consistently add notes on books I'm reading to the bookshelf notes
> - [ ] Rework entire `about` section, it could look better
> - [ ] Make the website more responsive overall, especially for mobile users (use Bootstrap or Django possibly?)

*I created this website with the intention of building a website from absolute scratch to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. I will be now trying to add as much JavaScript to the site as possible, as I am focusing on improving my fronted development skills*
