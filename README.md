> [ ] Create some kind of consistency around blog posts and optimize that workflow
> [ ] Consistently add notes on books I'm reading to the bookshelf notes
> [ ] Rework entire `about` section, it could look better
> [ ] Make the website more responsive overall, especially for mobile users (use Bootstrap or Django possibly?) 
> [ ] Get asboyer.com
> [ ] Get boyer.com

> *I created this website with the intention of building a website from absolute scratch to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. I will be now trying to add as much JavaScript to the site as possible, as I am focusing on improving my fronted development skills*
